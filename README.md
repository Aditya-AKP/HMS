This Project is a Hospital Management System
Our Project Hospital Management System includes the registration of patients, storing their details in the system, and also booking their appointments with doctors. Our software has the facility to give a unique ID for every patient and stores the details of every patient.

Users can search for the availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the ID. The Hospital Management System can be entered using a username and password. 

It is accessible either by an administrator or the patient itself. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected for personal use and make the data processing very fast.

 It has mainly two modules. One is at the Administration Level and the other one is for users i.e. patients and doctors. The Application maintains authentication to access the application. 

Administrator task includes managing doctors' information, and patientsâ€™ information. To achieve this aim a database was designed one for the patient and the other for the doctors which the admin can access. The Patient modules include checking appointments, and prescriptions.
